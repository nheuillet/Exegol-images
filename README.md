# Exegol images

> **ðŸ“Œ This repository hosts code for Exegol images, a submodule of the Exegol project.
> If you were looking for Exegol, go to [the main repo](https://github.com/ThePorgs/Exegol)**

This repository hosts Dockerfiles for each Exegol image, an installation script, and various assets needed during the install (custom configurations, a history file, an aliases file, etc.). These files can be used to locally build the docker images, there is however a pipeline in place to build and push images on DockerHub so that Exegol users don't have to build their own image.

More information on [the Exegol documenation](https://exegol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/the-exegol-project/docker-images.html).

## Architecture

All images are separated in different layers, known as intermediate images.
Images dependencies are as follows:
